This is a website that links to three different recipe's. This is the first project within The Odin Project's Foundations course. Here you will see use of the basics such as how a paragraph is creating,
various levels of headers (IE: `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>`), use of the bold and italic elements, relative and absolute links, and a bit more. For instance early on I found the images I pulled from websites to be jarringly huge, and decided I would resize them in the html document directly by manipulating width and height in the img element `<img src="image-source-path.extension" width="400" height="600" alt=""`.
