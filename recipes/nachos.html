        Nachos are always a favorite of groups, parties, or if ones feeling super dangerous,
        by themselves. The hardest part generally revolves around the <strong>nacho cheese</strong>
        which can be a bit tricky if you're unfamiliar with how to form a <em>roux</em>. However, this recipe
        will walk you through the basics, and hopefully give you the confidence to experiment some
        more with what you can do with a roux.

        Apart from the sauce staples such as sour creme, jalapenos, tomatoes and guac are a must. 
        Also, protiens like chicken or barbequoa are often used. The possibilities with nachos are 
        virtually endless as the dish itself is a hodge-podge of stuff tossed together over chips. 
        While we'll go over how to make the sauce and baseline ingredients you'll need, things like
        guacamole will not be covered here. However fear not! there's an amazing recipe for guac

    <h3 class="ingredients header">Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>3 teaspoon all purpose flour or 1 teaspoon cornmeal</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>4 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>3 cups cheese of choice(I generally blend 2 mild like jack and
            queso fresco with a sharper cheese like medium cheddar
        </li>
        <li>2 jalapenos slices, 1 diced</li>
        <li>1 roma tomatoe diced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sour creme</li>
        <li>bag of yellow or white corn tortilla chips(if you're feeling extra
            you can make your own corn tortillias and fry them. Find a recipe
            <a href="https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/homemade-corn-tortillas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>)
        
        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon: chipotle seasoning, pepper, garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="steps header">Steps:</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Start by cooking diced jalapenos till soft and sweaty. Remove and place to side</li>
        <li><strong><em>Sift</em></strong> flour into pan with medium low heat and butter
            melted. It's very important you sift, as it will prevent the roux from getting clumpy</li>
        
        <li>Once flour and butter mixture has been thoroughly blended and begins to thicken,
            reduce heat to low and add salt, chipotle seasoning, pepper, garlic and diced jalapeno
            (the one you cooked earlier)  
        </li>
        <li>add cup of milk and increase heat to medium high. Constantly stir until mixture begins
            to boil. Reduce heat to simmer and stir every minute or two
        </li>
        <li>Continue to stire and simmer until mixture capable of coating back of spoon. Turn off
            heat and add cheese blend one handful at a time and stir until fully blended with mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Plate chips. Add cheese sauce, jalapenos, sour cream, tomatoes, and any other ingredients
            you wish. </li>
