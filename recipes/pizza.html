        <h2>Cheese Pizza</h2>
        <p>
            Pizza is one of the most widely loved dishes in the American diet. Among any random
            sampling of people, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who didn't like some variation
            of the <em>three</em> simple ingredients.
        </p>

        <p>
            The three main ingredients in pizza are <strong>dough, sauce,</strong> and 
            <strong>cheese</strong>. All of which can be made by <strong><em>scratch</em></strong>
            or bought at your local grocer. This recipe is will have us making a simple cheese pizza
            assuming you've already made your dough and sauce, and have aquirred your cheese. 
        </p>

        <h3>ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>pizza dough</li>
            <li>pizza sauce</li>
            <li>mozzeral/provalone cheese blend</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
            
            <li>If you have a pizza stone, heat the stone for one hour.</li>
            
            <li>While the oven is heating, roll out your dough. Starting with a liberal base of
                flour and pressing your hands from the <strong>center</strong> to the <strong>edges</strong> 
                in a <em>cirular</em> motion.
            </li>

            <li>When you have finished, and you are comfortable with the width of your pizza, 
                apply your pizza sauce. Pour it in the center, and with a light touch and a ladel,
                gently spread it to the edges(where you wish your crust to begin).  
            </li>

            <li>Apply shredded cheese mix over the top, being sure to cover until all sauce is covered
                or to your liking.
            </li>

            <li>Cook for <strong>18-20</strong> minutes or until cheese is fully melted and begins to brown.</li>

            <li>Let cool for <strong>8-10</strong> minutes before cutting.</li>
        </ol>
