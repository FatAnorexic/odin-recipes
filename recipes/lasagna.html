    <h2>Homemade Lasagna</h2>

    <p>
        Continuing our series on food, this will help rid you of any excess cheese and sauce you may
        have left over from making pizza. Or perhaps, you were looking to simply make this as a
        standalone. Eitherway, lasagna is an amazingly delicious dish if not a little more involved
        than any of the other recipes in this list.

        There are several <em><strong>key</strong></em> ingredients you'll need to start out with.
        I've listed them out below, but a short hand list would be:<br>
        <strong>cheese, noodles, seasonings, tomatoes,sweet italian sausage, 
            ground beef, onion, garlic</strong><br>
        Prep time usually takes an hour or two, with a final bake time of about 45 minutes.
